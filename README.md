### An indie game by Simon Lee

After my first run of developing my first video game, ["Where's my Bread"](https://github.com/Simonlee711/Basic_Game), I am officially returning to the game developing community with my second run **Lost Self**

Like Where'd my Bread, I want to make everything from scratch from artwork, music, plot, etc. I will be making the game on an actual game engine, [GameMakerStudio2](https://gamemaker.io/en/gamemaker?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=US%20-%20Search%20-%20EN%20-%20Generic&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqoibBhDUARIsAH2OpWj8bF3_c62zsWEIGit6MQi6AtwKlKcU-QZKa4aBqtNJjfJEuxIosXQaAqrpEALw_wcB), so my game does not need to experience major processing lag like Find My Bread. Feel free to track my journey, as this will be one of my more long term projects I plan to work on.

# Synopsis

This game is widely inspired by the existential question: *why are we here?* It starts with a protaganist who does not have a purpose, but can embark on two diverging roads. One of which where he musters up the ability to accept himself for who he is, or the contrary where they are trying to overcome who they once were. The playstyle of the game is very much up to the player in determining which road they want to take. The Plot is very much still a work in progress, so this repository will be updated as I progress along.

# Motivation to start another game

Unfortunately I am bored but have been really inspired by people's natural abilities to tell stories. Also through the unique composition of bringing together a plot, music, and artwork, I feel like this has been the most beautiful form of storytelling. Therefore unlike my first game, I want to live through the character and tell a story I am proud of. Everything from aesthetic of the game to the hero's journey was originally designed by yours truly. 

This game is also a way to highlight some of my favorite video game mechanics of all time drawing inspiration from some of my favorite games. It is going to be an OG Role playing Game format, where there is a mixture of open world access while following the path of an unavoidable plot. Therefore I am excited to begin embarking on this journey.
